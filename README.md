## Logos

### Shape

The [Nabla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del) (âˆ‡) logo consists of two interlocking triangles. One is light on the dark background, the other is dark on the first.

### Colors

The color used for the logos are `#000000` absolute black and `#ffffff` absolute white.

### Sizes

Logos must always maintain the same aspect ratio. They are designed to have a square shape.

They are available in several sizes:

| Size | Resolution |
|---|---|
| Big  |  1250x1250 px |
| Medium  | 800x1250 px  |
| Small  |  300x300 px |

## Typography

The rich font used for logos and important content (titles, subtitles...) is [Vollkorn](https://github.com/FAlthausen/Vollkorn-Typeface) by Friedrich Althausen.

The monofont used to display code and raw content is [Inconsolata](https://github.com/googlefonts/Inconsolata) by Raph Levien.

Both fonts are available under the [SIL Open Font License (OFL)](https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL).
